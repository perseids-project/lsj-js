      Where the works of an author have been divided into recognized chapters and sections these are
      usually given, and the orators are (when possible) cited by speech and section; but references
      by page are given in accordance with custom to Aristotle (Bekker), the commentators on
      Aristotle (Berlin edition), Plato (Stephanus), Philo (Mangey), Plutarch&apos;s
      {' '}
      <u>Moralia</u>
      {' '}
      {' '}
(Wyttenbach), Galen (Kühn, except for certain recently edited treatises), Athenaeus
      (Casaubon), Julian (Spanheim), and Themistius (Hardouin). Page-references to other authors are
      in general introduced by &apos;p.&apos; and followed by the initial of the editor&apos;s name;
      if not, the facts are stated in List I. The symbol&apos;
      <u>Fr</u>
.&apos; (=
      <u>Fragment</u>
）
      {' '}
is generally used where the remains of an author consist partly of complete works and
      partly of quotations&semi; a simple number denotes a fragment drawn from one of the
      collections indicated in List I. Where supplementary or recent but uncompleted collections
      are quoted, the initial of the editor (e.g. &apos; D.&apos; for Demiańczuk, &apos;J.&apos; for
      Jacoby) is added to the number of the fragment. The annotations of ancient commentators are
      cited either by reference to the passage discussed or as substantive works: thus &apos;Ulp. ad
      D.&apos; followed by reference to speech and section, but &apos;Did.
      <u>in D</u>
.&apos; cited
      by column and line of papyrus.
