        Where the works of an author have been divided into recognized chapters and sections these are
        usually given, and the orators are (when possible) cited by speech and section; but references
        by page are given in accordance with custom to Aristotle (Bekker), the commentators on
        Aristotle (Berlin edition), Plato (Stephanus), Philo (Mangey), Plutarch&apos;s

  (Wyttenbach), Galen (Kühn, except for certain recently edited treatises), Athenaeus
        (Casaubon), Julian (Spanheim), and Themistius (Hardouin). Page-references to other authors are
        in general introduced by &apos;p.&apos; and followed by the initial of the editor&apos;s name;
        if not, the facts are stated in List I. The symbol&apos;

  is generally used where the remains of an author consist partly of complete works and
        partly of quotations&semi; a simple number denotes a fragment drawn from one of the
        collections indicated in List I. Where supplementary or recent but uncompleted collections
        are quoted, the initial of the editor (e.g. &apos; D.&apos; for Demiańczuk, &apos;J.&apos; for
        Jacoby) is added to the number of the fragment. The annotations of ancient commentators are
        cited either by reference to the passage discussed or as substantive works: thus &apos;Ulp. ad
