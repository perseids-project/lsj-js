    <p>
	The Delegates of the Oxford University Press, in issuing the tenth and
	last part of the revised edition of Liddell and Scott&apos;s Greek Lexicon,
	wish to express their deep gratitude to all who have assisted in carrying
	this undertaking to a conclusion. They greatly regret that neither the Editor
	Sir Henry Stuart Jones, who died on 29 June 1939, nor the Assistant Editor Mr.
	Roderick McKenzie, who died on 24 June 1937, survived to see the work completed.
	McKenzie saw the main body of the work to its end, and himself wrote the long article
	on ὡς; Sir Henry was at work on the Addenda and Corrigenda up to within a fortnight of
	his death and had almost put them into shape. The work done by these two men could
	not be overrated. Sir Henry was the ideal Editor; his wide range of knowledge and his
	exact scholarship, his persistent devotion to his task even in periods of ill health,
	his tactful assiduity in consulting experts and his skill in co-ordinating their results,
	gave the work at once its consistency and its elasticity. McKenzie, to whom fell the arrangement,
	 in their ultimate form, of most of the articles, provided a fine complement; his great knowledge
	 of comparative philology, his laborious accuracy, and his tireless patience, gave his
	 contribution inestimable value.
    </p>

    <p>
	In the Preface published in 1925 Stuart Jones sketched the history of the work up to the
	publication of ἀποβαίνω, and recorded the signal services given by many scholars to the work
	in its formative stages. To that nothing need now be added. But Jones went on to thank the
	scholars who were &apos; generously devoting their time to the reading of proof-sheets and the
	verification of references&apos;. It is important that the nature of this work should be understood.
	The procedure adopted, when work was resumed after the Four Years&apos; War, was this: McKenzie wrote
	out Jones&apos;s corrections on a &apos;paste-up&apos; of the previous edition. This was the &apos;copy&apos;; and fresh
	material was to some extent incorporated in it from time to time. But as succeeding sections of
	the alphabet were revised and set up in type, proofs were sent to the volunteer helpers, whose
	labours, in the event, went far beyond mere verification; in their hands and the editors&apos; the work
	was very largely recast. The method has obvious advantages, and the peculiar excellences of the revised
	lexicon owe much to its adoption. But inevitably it prolonged the process of gestation. The period of
	publication, 1925-40, was actually longer than the period of copy-writing, 1911-24, even although the
	earlier period was interrupted by the war, and in the later period there were two editors instead of one.
    </p>

    <p>
	Of those who were named in the original Preface as having embarked on the labour of proof-reading,
	 some are dead: notably Sir William T. Thiselton-Dyer, A. C. Pearson, and Herbert Greene.

	  Others
	 have lived to see the work to its end. These, and not these alone, have more than doubled the debt
	 of gratitude which, fifteen years ago, Jones could not &apos;find words adequate to express&apos;.
    </p>

    <p>
	Unhappily neither editor lived to prepare a final list of acknowledgements. McKenzie died
	suddenly in 1937. Jones, though he lived to see the end in sight, left no material for the
	brief &apos;epilogue&apos; which it had been agreed he should furnish. It would be impossible now to
	produce a complete or balanced account of the labours of the proof-readers and verifiers without
	undertaking inquiries which the circumstances of the time make difficult. The list which follows
	does not attempt discrimination. Special mention must, however, be made of the prolonged and arduous
	labours of Mr. M. N. Tod of Oriel College on the inscriptions; of Lt.-Col. A. S. L. Farquharson of
	University College on Plato and Aristotle; of Dr. E. T. Withington of Balliol College on the medical
	writers; of Sir D&apos;Arcy Thompson of St. Andrews on natural history; and of the late Sir Thomas Heath
	on mathematics and astrology.
    </p>

    <p>
	The proofs were read also, in whole or in part, by the following: Mr. P. V. M. Benecke of Magdalen
	College; Mr. F. H. Colson of St. John&apos;s College, Cambridge; Mr. Christopher Cookson of Magdalen College;
	Prof. E. S. Forster of Sheffield University; Mr. E. T. D. Jenkins of University College, Aberystwyth; Mr.
	Edgar Lobel of the Queen&apos;s College; Mr. W. L. Lorimer of St. Andrews; Prof. J. F. Mountford of Liverpool
	University; Mr. Maurice Platnauer of Brasenose College; Sir David Ross, Provost of Oriel College;
	Prof. A. E. Taylor of Edinburgh; and by the late F. W. Hall, A. E. Housman, A. C. Pearson, J. A. Smith,
	and J. L. Stocks. As press reader from the beginning of the work Mr. T. Bruce has made a special contribution
	to its accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
	The Addenda and Corrigenda issued with the several parts have been greatly enlarged, and are now consolidated
	in a single list. Of these, the proofs were read by Dr. H. Idris Bell of the British Museum, Prof. G. R. Driver
	of Magdalen College, and Prof. Paul Maas of Königsberg, as well as by some of those who have been named above.
    </p>

    <p>
	The Addenda owe much to the reviews and private communications of Dr. Ernest Harrison of Trinity College,
	Cambridge; of Prof. Maas; of Prof. R. Pfeiffer of Munich (it is noted with pleasure that both Prof. Maas
	and Prof. Pfeiffer are now resident in Oxford); of Prof. K. Latte of Hamburg; of Prof. W. Schmid of Tübingen;
	of Herr Pfarrer P. Katz of Coblenz, and of many other scholars.
    </p>

    <p>
	Both in the Addenda and in the main work the principle of anonymity has been applied to original contributions
	that appear first in the Lexicon, and it was the intention of the Editors that those who made them should be
	free at any later time to claim their own discoveries.

    </p>

    <p>
	It is impossible now, as it was impossible in 1925, to name all who have contributed to the improvement
	of the great lexicon. The sacrifice of leisure, and the devotion to Greek learning, of which Jones then wrote,
	have been nobly sustained by a generation of scholars, and the monument of unselfish industry is at last complete.
